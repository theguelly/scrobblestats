## What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique commonly encountered when working with data structures and algorithms. It involves a function calling itself to solve a problem. Here are some tips for writing recursive functions:

1. **Identify the Base Case:** Begin by determining when the recursion should stop, which is known as the base case. This is the condition under which the function returns a result without making a recursive call.

2. **Recognize Patterns and Define the Recursive Case:** Identify patterns that allow you to break the problem into smaller, similar subproblems. Define how to address these subproblems in the recursive case, typically by calling the function itself with modified inputs.

3. **Ensure Termination:** Make sure the recursion will reach the base case. This prevents infinite recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow error.

4. **Choose Appropriate Function Arguments:** Select arguments that effectively express the problem's state and progress toward the base case. These arguments should change with each recursive call, moving closer to the base case.

5. **Consider Separating Main and Recursive Functions:** For improved readability and reusability, consider separating the primary function from the recursive helper function. The helper function handles the recursive logic, while the main function sets up the initial parameters.

6. **Understand Limitations:** Not all problems, especially those typically solved iteratively, are suitable for recursion. It's essential to recognize when recursion is a good fit for a problem.

7. **Opt for Iteration When Appropriate:** In cases where iterative solutions are more readable and performant, consider converting recursive functions to iterative ones. Some problems are naturally solved more efficiently using loops.

These tips should help you write recursive functions effectively and avoid common pitfalls. Recursion is a powerful tool, particularly in algorithms and data structures, but it requires careful planning and understanding of the problem at hand.
